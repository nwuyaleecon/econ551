\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item \[ E[h(1,u) - h(0,u)] = E[h(1,u)] - E[h(0,u)] = E[y|d=1] - E[y|d=0] = \tau + \alpha  - \alpha = \tau \]
\item The estimator is given by
\[ \frac{1}{N}\sum (y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\tau}d_i) = 0 \]
\[ \frac{1}{N}\sum (y_i - \hat{\alpha} - \hat{\tau}d_i)d_i = 0 \]
Let $D = \sum d_i$. Then
\[ \frac{1}{N}\sum y_i = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau}(D/N)  \]
\[ \frac{1}{N}\sum y_id_i = \hat{\alpha}(D/N) + \hat{\tau}(D/N)  \]
\[ \frac{D}{N^2}\sum y_i = \hat{\alpha}(D/N) + \hat{\tau}(D^2/N^2)  \]
\[ \frac{1}{N}\sum y_id_i - (D/N)\frac{1}{N}\sum y_i  = \hat{\tau}(D/N)(1 - D/N)  \]
\[ Cov(y, d) = \hat{\tau} Var(d) \]
\[ \frac{Cov(y, d)}{Var(d)} = \hat{\tau} \]
Note this is exactly the same as doing OLS on $y$ with $d$. See code. The estimated value is approx 886.3 with standard error approx 472.086
\item See code and annotations for work. The estimate is 794.3885736971342 and the standard error is 480.3028362343343.
