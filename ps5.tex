\section*{12.1}
The estimator is
\[ \hat{\beta}_{IV} = \frac{\sum_i y_i d_i}{\sum_i z_i d_i} = \frac{\sum_{i \mid d_i = 1} y_i }{\sum_{i \mid d_i = 1} z_i} \]
\section*{12.8}
Let $X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & P & Y \end{bmatrix}'$, $Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & W & Y \end{bmatrix}'$, and let $a = \begin{bmatrix} a_0 & a_1 & a_2 \end{bmatrix}'$. Then we have
\[Q = X'a + e_1 \]
\[ ZQ = ZX'a + Ze_1 \]
\[ E[ZQ] = E[ZX']a + E[Ze_1] \]
Since $Z$ is determined outside the market, $E[Ze_1] = 0$, so
\[ a = (E[ZX'])^{-1}E[ZQ] \]
so $a$ is identified as long as $E[ZX']$ is invertible. Similarly, if we let $X_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & P & W \end{bmatrix}'$, we get
\[ b = (E[ZX_2'])^{-1}E[ZQ] \]
so $b$ is identified as long as $E[ZX_2']$ is invertible.
